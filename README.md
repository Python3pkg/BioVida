BioVida: Curating BioMedical Information
===


**Overview**:

Publicly available online repositories currently store enormous amounts of data on numerous human diseases. However, 
these databases are often built to serve wildly different purposes, making it difficult to explore connections between 
them. This project aims to tame this problem and integrate several of these public sources together.

This project aims to develop an easy-to-use API which will harvest the latest 
information on human diseases from public databases.  

**Objectives**:

   1. Images
   
        - from the NIH's *Open-i* Database (and perhaps others)
        
        - these images will be automatically processed to make them amenable to machine learning algorithms.

   2. Genomic Data
   
        - likely from the NIH's *Genome* database
    
   3. Diagnostic Data
   
        - symptom information
        
        - source currently unclear
        

Ultimately, the goal of this project is to develop a tool which simply asks 
the user for the name of a disease and will return a database of information on that illness.
